# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my **LeetCode problem solutions repository**, organized by problem rather than language. This collection showcases my approach to solving coding challenges using **Python, Java, Elixir, Go, and Rust**.

## Overview

Each folder corresponds to a specific problem and may contain multiple implementations in different programming languages. The repository covers a wide range of topics, including:

* Arrays and Strings
* Linked Lists and Trees
* Dynamic Programming
* Graph Algorithms
* Backtracking and Recursion

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Leetcode-Solutions.git
```

2. Navigate to the folder of the problem you want to explore:

```bash
cd problem
```

3. Choose the solution in your preferred language and run it using the standard command. For example, in Python:

```bash
python solution.py
```

## Purpose

This repository is designed to:

* Practice algorithmic and data structure problems efficiently
* Demonstrate versatility across multiple programming languages
* Serve as a reference for solving coding interview challenges
